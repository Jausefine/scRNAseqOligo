# scRNAseqOligo

Eight mouse and seven human datasets published from 2015 to early 2020 from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO) were selected for further analysis. 
The selection criteria included the number of cells, the occurrence of oligodendrocytes, and the condition of respective organisms. Mouse scRNA-seq datasets were 
provided by Zeisel et al. (2015), Marques et al. (2016), Falcão et al. (2018), Saunders et al. (2018), Zeisel et al. (2018; Ximerakis et al.), Wheeler et al. (2020)
and Zhou et al. (2020) (Table 1), and human scRNA-seq datasets were obtained from Habib et al. (2017), Lake et al. (2018), Grubman et al. (2019), Jäkel et al. (2019) ,
Mathys et al. (2019), Wheeler et al. (2020) and Zhou et al. (2020)


The selected datasets were organized, and quality control was performed separately by using the Seurat R package (Version 3.1.4).
We followed the Seurat Tutorials provided by Satija Lab (e.g. https://satijalab.org/seurat/archive/v3.0/pbmc3k_tutorial.html)
